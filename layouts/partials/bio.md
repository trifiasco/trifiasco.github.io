I build high-performance data pipelines and scalable distributed systems with 6+ years of experience, currently at Xeneta.

I work in the terminal with neovim and tmux. My [dotfiles](https://github.com/trifiasco/dotfiles) are on GitHub.

I type on a Kinesis Advantage360 Pro with a [custom ZMK layout](https://github.com/trifiasco/Adv360-Pro-ZMK/blob/V3.0/config/adv360.keymap).

Outside of work, I run and cycle. I occasionally [write about it](/posts/run_cycle_2025_review/).
