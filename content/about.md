I've been writing code professionally for 6+ years, building backend systems and data infrastructure.

My path into software started with competitive programming—2x ACM-ICPC regionals participant, and solved 1000+ problems across different judges. That problem-solving foundation shaped how I approach engineering: break down complexity, optimize for performance, understand the system deeply.

These days I work on data infrastructure. Recent projects include a DBT/Snowflake pipeline that cut data ingestion time by 81%, a fault-tolerant reporting service with 99.9% uptime using AWS Lambda and Step Functions, and observability tooling with Datadog that improved incident response by 75%. I care about developer experience—automated onboarding that reduced setup time from 4 hours to 15 minutes.

I work in the terminal—neovim, tmux, zsh. Type on a Kinesis Advantage360 Pro with a custom ZMK layout. I've spent enough time configuring LSPs and keybindings to have opinions about them.

Outside of work, I run and cycle. Completed 300km running and 800km cycling in 2025, which I wrote about in [this post](/posts/run_cycle_2025_review/).

*2x AWS Certified (Developer Associate, Cloud Practitioner)*.

My primary tech stack includes *Python, Rust, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, DBT, Terraform*.
